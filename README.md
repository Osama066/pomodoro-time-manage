# pomodoro-time-manage
It  is a Python program that creates a Pomodoro timer with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the `tkinter` library. It simulates the Pomodoro Technique, allowing you to work in timed intervals and take short breaks.

Let's go through the code step-by-step to understand its functionality:

1. **Imports and Constants:** The required modules and some constants are defined at the beginning. The constants include colors (PINK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW) and time settings for work, short break, and long break durations (WORK_MIN, SHORT_BREAK_MIN, LONG_BREAK_MIN).

2. **Reset Timer Function:** `reset_timer()` is a function that resets the timer to its initial state. It cancels the current timer (if any), sets the countdown text to "00:00", resets the title label to "Timer," and clears any previous checkmarks.

3. **Start Timer Function:** `start_timer()` is the core of the Pomodoro timer logic. It calculates the time for the next session (work, short break, or long break) based on the number of completed sessions (reps) and updates the title label accordingly. It then calls `count_down()` to initiate the countdown.

4. **Count Down Function:** `count_down(count)` is a recursive function that handles the countdown mechanism. It takes the time in seconds as input and converts it into minutes and seconds. It updates the timer text on the canvas every second until the countdown reaches 0. After a session ends, it calls `start_timer()` again to initiate the next session or break.

5. **UI Setup:** The GUI elements are created using `tkinter`. The main window is set up with a title and padding. The title label, canvas with a tomato image, timer text, start button, reset button, and checkmark label are positioned on the window using the `grid` method.

6. **Main Function:** The main function `pomo_func()` initializes the GUI and starts the tkinter main loop (`window.mainloop()`), making the GUI interactive.

The code creates a Pomodoro timer window with a tomato image representing the work session. The timer counts down for each session (work or break), and checkmarks are displayed below the timer to represent the completed work sessions.

Remember to adjust the image path for the `tomato_img` variable in the `canvas.create_image()` call to point to the actual location of the tomato image on your system.

When you run the program, you'll see the GUI window with the timer and buttons. Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer and take short breaks after each work session. You can stop and reset the timer using the "Reset" button.
